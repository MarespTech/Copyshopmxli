# Copyshop Webpage

Copyshop page was my first project about web programming, there's a page for my father's bussines. 
The page consist in three pages: the main page, where's the information in general and connect with the other two pages. The services page, where's the client can see what services do. And the cotization pages, where the client can make a cotization of the work that he need to get.

The pages was created using html, css and javascript only.
